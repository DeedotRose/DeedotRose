## &#128105;&#127998; My Role ##
My title is Health Promotion Specialist.

## :star2:	My Style ##
- I can be quiet and reserved at first, but once I'm settled in, I'm quite delighful!:relaxed: I joke a little and I try not to take myself too seriously. I enjoy getting to know people and having people get to know me. I'm told I have a very expressive face, which I accept that a lot of the time the expressions mirror what I'm feeling, but at times, my resting face says, "do you wanna fight" when I really don't.
- I often need to take notes while reading or listening to something, which I refer to later on.  It can be difficult sometimes for me to remember information just from listening with no visual accompaniment, so may see me taking notes in a meeting. Unless the meeting organizer plans to send notes afterwards.
- My life depends on my Google Calendar, so I need any and all events to be on it so I can organize myself accordingly.  If it's not on my calendar, it doesn't exist.
- I tend go back and forth between tasks on my to-do list to break up monotony and keep my day interesting.  
  
## :muscle:&#127998; My Strengths ##
- Writing! Sometimes can take me a minute to organize my thoughts and put them on paper, but I'm a very good writer.  It's easier for me to write a story than to recount it verbally.  
- Knowledge exchange. I have experience with presenting information to large groups and working with individuals in health education in different formats.
- Building rapport and active listening.                                      
- Research and learning new things.  I do tend to go on deep dives, and need to reel myself, or be reeled back in.

## :triangular_flag_on_post:	My Challenges ##
- I'm great with words, but numbers are my nemesis. I often have to double check number sequences that I read or write because I sometimes transpose them.
- I have lupus nephritis, which means I have systemic lupus and chronic kidney disease, so I have bouts where I struggle with pain and fatigue and need to take breaks to restore myself. I don't always take those breaks right when I need to, and try to push through and I end up completely spent.  I'm working on being gentler with myself and listening to my body when it tells me things. I'm trying to live by these quotes: "If you don't make time for your wellness, you will be forced to make time for your illness" and "if you don't pick a day to relax, your body will pick it for you". I will also try to let you know if I need to take a break for a few hours or a day. Having lupus nephritis also means I have a lot of appointments for monitoring and/or treatments, but I always try to make sure I balance appointments with my work schedule.
- Transitioning to working in a different way after working for a long time in frontline clinical work has been a bit of a challenge. My brain is learning that not everything is a breakneck emergency and my cortisol level is probably slowly working it's way down. I don't know if that's real science, but it's what I imagine is happening.  

## :heart_eyes:	My Likes ##
- Rest, prioritizing my health and wellbeing. I'm working on it (see above) I'm working on practicing vulnerability and authenticity  - resisting respectability and the restrictions it puts/has put onto self expression.
- Music - a range of genres, but I will sometimes play my soca playlist or the Renaissance album in the morning to get hype and do a little shimmy while on the TTC. I sometimes hum while I'm working, but if we're in the office together and it's loud or bothersome, please let me know.
- I love reading for pleasure, but it's rare these days that I actually do.  I've had to return quite a few books to the library before finishing them, and I am that person who tries to push a day or two after the due date to get as far as I can.  I'm so thankful that they eliminated late fees :rofl:
- I'm an avid TV watcher. I enjoy Reality tv - it was a much welcome escape after hard days at work. Faves: The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Beverly Hills, Dubai, New York and Potomac, Top Chef (US and Canada) and the many iterations of Drag Race (US, UK and Canada). I watch scripted shows as well, too many to list, but Abbott Elementary is at the top. 
- Podcasts! I listen to A LOT of different ones, but my #1 fave is The Read. I am very much open to recommendations for other shows to watch or listen to.

## :no_entry:	My Dislikes ##
Injustice; erasure; medical bias, racism and gaslighting; bad food, especially if it's overpriced; when technology doesn't work; unrealistic expectations and timelines; inflexibility; unwillingness to learn.

## 📫 How to reach me and how I like to communicate :speaking_head: ##

- I've learned that I'm most easily reached on Slack first then email. My gmail notifications arent as reliable, so I'm more likely to see a Slack message as soon as its sent, than I am with email.  You can also text, but sometimes those get lost in the fray too. For email messages, I can be expected to reply by the end of the day or the following morning.
- I love a step-by-step explanation of how to do something even if it seems like it should be common sense. I may do things a different way or develop my own process afterwards, but I need the basics to start from.  
- I will ask questions for clarity and to make sure that I'm doing things correctly or moving in the right direction.
- I welcome feedback and correction so I can course correct when necessary.

 <details> <summary> <b><h2>:open_book:	Additional Fun Facts</h2></b> </summary>
<li> I've been living in Toronto since 2011. </li>
<li> I like to travel internationally, though I haven't done much since COVID-19 entered the chat. My (close) family is everywhere but Canada, so it's a necessity, but it also means I haven't seen a lot of folks for many years :frowning_face:. </li>
<li> I'm from Queens, NY and I had a Queens accent as a kid. My mom is Jamaican and my dad is Zimbabwean and that, plus moving in and out of the US a few times as a kid led to the loss of that accent. What's left is a generic American accent that I can slip out of when I'm speaking a different language.</li>
<li> I speak un poco Espa&ntilde;ol which I've been studying for a few years.  I recently became good at it because of the influx of Spanish speaking newcomers that I interacted with in my previous employment.  I'm hoping I can keep it up.</li>
