## My Role ##
My title is Health Promotion Specialist 
## My Style ##
Open to feedback. I sometimes go back and forth between tasks to break up any monotony.  I often need to take notes while reading or listening to something, which I refer to later on.  It can be difficult sometimes for me to remember information just from listening with no visual accompaniment, so may see me taking notes in a meeting
## :muscle:&#127998; My Strengths ##
Writing! Sometimes can take me a minute to organize my thoughts and put them on paper, but I'm a very good writer.  It's easier for me to write a story than to recount it verbally.
## &#129318;&#127998;	My Challenges ##
I'm notorious for letting the battery on my devices run down and I have to scramble to get a charger in its last few minutes of juice.
I have bouts where I struggle with pain and fatigue and have to take breaks to restore myself. I also sometimes don't take those breaks right when I need to, and opt to push through and I end up completely spent.  I'm working on it. "If you don't make time for your wellness, you will be forced to make time for your illness" "if you don't pick a day to relax, your body will pick it for you"

## My Likes ##
Rest, prioritizing my health and wellbeing. I'm working on it (see above) I'm working on practicing vulnerability and 
authenticity  - resisting respectability.
Music - a range of genres, but I will sometimes play my soca playlist in the morning to get hype and do a little shimmy while on the TTC. I sometimes hum while I'm working. I love reading for pleasure, but it's rare these days that I actually do.  I've had to return quite a few books to the library before finishing them, and I am that person who tries to push a day or two after the due date to get as far as I can.  I'm so thankful that they eliminated late fees :rofl:
I'm an avid TV watcher. I enjoy Reality tv - it was a much welcome escape after hard days at work. Faves: The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Beverly Hills, Dubai, New York and Potomac, Top Chef (US and Canada) and the many iterations of Drag Race (US, UK and Canada). I watch scripted shows as well, too many to list, but Abbott Elementary is at the top. 
Podcasts! I listen to A LOT of different ones, but my faves are The Read, Jade and XD Presents, The Secret Life of Canada, Slow Burn. I am very much open to recommendations for other shows to watch or listen to.
## My Dislikes &#x1F937;&#x1F3FE;&#x200D;&#x2640; ##
injustice, erasure
## Communication ##

I'm most easily reached on Slack first then email. My gmail notifications on my phone can be glitchy, so if I'm away from my computer,  I'm more likely to see a Slack message as soon as its sent, than I am with email.  Folks Can also text. For email messages, I can be expected to reply within a few hours.
